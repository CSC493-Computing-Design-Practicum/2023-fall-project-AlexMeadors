Goals: The project is to create an app that will help boost productivity in the user by helping keep them on track with various methods and options. It will track the tasks you are hoping to accomplish and their deadlines to help organize them, and also allow you to sort by priority, 

Context: There are many people with problems staying focused on tasks such as homework, especially in this increasingly attention demanding world full of ads and social media skinner boxes made to trap your attention for as long as they can.

Novelty: I would like to improve on the general task management / todo list by having the notifications when the user is off task, and regular reminders of their things to do.

Functionality: I expect the project to be able to handle multiple users, keep track of each's tasks, allow them to modify their own tasks, notifications when they have been off task for an amount of time by tracking the windows they have in focus. There will also be regular reminders of your tasks you have to do, with the frequency being determined by the priority of the task and the distance of the deadline. I also want people to be able to break down their tasks into subtasks, for example making a sandwich you could break it down to get ingredients, get silverware, open containers, assemble sandwich. One large task with a timer beneath it can be intimidating, smaller goals will help with that.

Audience: The main audience will be people with work to do on the computer so mostly students and workers who use computers for their main job, their main uses will be a plethora of assignments and deadlines. Assignments will tend to be short term and frequent, but unlike adults who will mostly just have to deal with the tasks they have in order and tend to be more spread out(bills). This requires a balance between short term frequent reminders like students would need due to a lot of assignments due the next day or two, and the long term reminders that an older audience would prefer(daily  

Challenges: I expect to run into issues with the reminder system as I haven't had a chance to work with apps that work over an extended period of time, and also the database portion as I am unfamiliar there as well.

Measures: I will view this project as a success when it can take an arbitrary number of tasks, order them based on the deadline, the user can alter these tasks at any time, remove them, get notifications if "off task" for 15 minutes.

Motivation: I personally have had issues keeping myself on task for work, resulting in a lot of wasted time that wasn't even enjoyable. If I can make something to help myself with that it would help my work ethic and quality of life and I know many others that also struggle.

Future Extensions: If time allows I could add ChatGPT support to suggest useful subtasks for each main task or even other subtasks.
